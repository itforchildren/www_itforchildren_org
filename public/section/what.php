									<p>Now we are collecting used laptops from companies and individuals in Sweden, sending them to Ghana and installing them in schools there, along with 3G modem networks securing internet access. In this way we recycle computers that are no longer needed by their owners in Sweden, redistributing them to a developing country where they are wished for, needed and crucial for future development.</p>
